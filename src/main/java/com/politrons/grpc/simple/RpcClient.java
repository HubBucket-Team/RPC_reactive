/**
 * After we create the classes through the contract that we deifne(rcp_contract.proto) we can use already the

 * In order to create the stub we need first a channel, which has been created through the ManagedChannelBuilder.
 * <p>
 * Once that you have the stub, you can decide which strategy do you want for the communication, creating:
 * <p>
 * newBlockingStub --> Return a RpcServiceBlockingStub which can be used to invoke the remote method synchronously
 * newFutureStub   --> Return a RpcServiceFutureStub which can be used to invoke the remote method asynchronously returning a ListenableFuture
 * newStub         --> Return a RpcServiceFutureStub which can be used to invoke the remote method asynchronously returning a Stub
